Imsearch is a desktop application for searching, comparing, and discovering similar images within a directory. Built with a custom-themed, user-friendly interface using [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), Imsearch leverages deep learning models to analyze and rank images by similarity, making it ideal for photographers, designers, researchers, and anyone working with large image collections.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark/light theme toggle.
- **Easy Image Upload**: Quickly upload an image to use as a search query.
- **Directory Selection**: Choose any folder to search for similar images.
- **Deep/Nested Search**: Option to search subdirectories for images.
- **Similarity Sorting**: Images are ranked from most similar to least similar using advanced models (`DINO` and `MobileNet`).
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress bar and loading spinner for long searches.
- **Model Selection**: Automatic selection between `DINO` (for accuracy) and `MobileNet` (for speed).
- **Result Visualization**: Grid view of results with image previews; double-click to open images directly.

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Select an image as your search query.
2. **Select a Directory**: Choose the folder containing images to search.
3. **Choose Search Options**: Enable "Deep Check" to include subfolders.
4. **Start Search**: Click "Check" to begin. The app will process and rank images by similarity.
5. **View Results**: See the most similar images in a grid, sorted by relevance. Double-click any image to open it.

## How to build

To build imsearch, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Iftekhar-Ifat/imsearch.git
cd imsearch
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Install dependencies using Conda (recommended):

```sh
conda env create -f imsearch-conda-env.yml
conda activate imsearch-env
```

### 3. Run the Application

```sh
python app.py
```

## Model Files

- `DINO` and `MobileNet` model files are required in the `models/` directory. These are used for feature extraction and similarity computation.
