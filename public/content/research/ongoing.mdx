- Currently engaged in a [InteX](https://www.intexlab.net/) funded research project focused on adversarial attack/defense on dental imaging. The study utilizes Meta's `Segment Anything Model (SAM)` for initial segmentation and a refined UNet variants for detailed tooth detection and adversarial robustness (adversarial attack/defense).

- Secured funding from the **National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA)** of the **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)** for the research proposal **"Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Platform for the Healthcare Domain"** and currently leading this initiative.

- Working with [Dr. Md Rashedur Rahman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-rashedur-rahman-d-eng-25b5b7145/) on a dental panoramic x-ray image segmentation techniques; exploring various state-of-the art segmentation model architecture`,
